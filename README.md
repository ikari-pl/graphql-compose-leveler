# graphql-compose-leveler

> Lets GraphQL servers allow client queries to mutate the shape of response objects.

A [`graphql-leveler`][graphql-leveler] inspired util for use with [`graphql-compose`][graphql-leveler].
 
 It allows GraphQL servers built with `graphql-compose` to let clients modify the output format by flattenning deeper structures or, to the contrary, adding depth where GraphQL objects would normally return flat fields.
