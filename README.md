# graphql-compose-leveler

> Lets GraphQL servers allow client queries to mutate the shape of response objects.

A [`graphql-leveler`][graphql-leveler] inspired util for use with [`graphql-compose`][graphql-leveler].
 
 It allows GraphQL servers built with `graphql-compose` to let clients modify the output format by flattenning deeper structures or, to the contrary, adding depth where GraphQL objects would normally return flat fields.

## Background
 
 A developer once asked for a feature that [graphql-leveler][graphql-leveler] provides, but our API was built using the awesome library called [graphql-compose][graphql-compose]. It required replacing all `GraphQLObjectType`s in the source code of the app with `LevelerObjectType`.
  
  But since we used `graphql-compose`, the `TypeComposer` interface and its GraphQL-schema parser, we couldn't always replace the base type easily (in schema syntax). 
  
  On the other hand, `graphql-compose` allowed us to modify the types anytime before the schema is finally generated and passed to the GraphQL server. So after discovering that `graphql-leveler`'s code is very simple, I've reimplemented its functionality using `TypeComposer` magic. 
 
 
## Install

`npm install --save graphql-compose-leveler`

## Development

## Usage

```js
const leveler = require("graphql-compose-leveler");

// You usually start with creating a ComposeStorage
const GQC = new ComposeStorage();
// ... building API ...
// now add leveler's magic to all queries in rootQuery 
levelerize(GQC);
// ... and finally build schema:
const schema = GQC.buildSchema();
```
