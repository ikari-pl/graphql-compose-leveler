# graphql-compose-leveler

> Lets GraphQL servers allow client queries to mutate the shape of response objects.

A [`graphql-leveler`][graphql-leveler] inspired util for use with [`graphql-compose`][graphql-leveler].
 
 It allows GraphQL servers built with `graphql-compose` to let clients modify the output format by flattenning deeper structures or, to the contrary, adding depth where GraphQL objects would normally return flat fields.

## Background
 
 [A fellow developer](https://github.com/deviousm) once asked for a feature that [graphql-leveler][graphql-leveler] provides, but our API was built using the awesome library called [graphql-compose][graphql-compose]. It required replacing all `GraphQLObjectType`s in the source code of the app with `LevelerObjectType`.
  
  But since we used `graphql-compose`, the `TypeComposer` interface and its GraphQL-schema parser, we couldn't always replace the base type easily (in schema syntax). 
  
  On the other hand, `graphql-compose` allowed us to modify the types anytime before the schema is finally generated and passed to the GraphQL server. So after discovering that `graphql-leveler`'s code is very simple, I've reimplemented its functionality using `TypeComposer` magic, and added a `_pluck` on top of its `_get`.
 
 
## Install

```bash
npm install --save graphql-compose-leveler
```

```js
const levelerize = require("graphql-compose-leveler");

// You usually start with creating a ComposeStorage
const GQC = new ComposeStorage();
// ... building API ...
// now add leveler's magic to all queries in rootQuery 
levelerize(GQC.rootQuery());
// ... and finally build schema:
const schema = GQC.buildSchema();
```

## Usage

Now having a response that would look like this:
```json
{
  "a": {
    "very": {
      "deeply": {
        "nested": {
          "single": "value",
          "list": [
            {
              "item": "of"
            }, {
              "item": "values"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can query like you used to:
```graphql
query {
  a {
    very {
      deeply {
        nested {
          single
          list {
            item
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

but also:
```graphql
query {
  a { thing: _get(path: "very.deeply.nested.single") }
}
```
which returns
```json
{
  "a": {
    "thing": "value"
  }
}
```

and/or 
```graphql
query {
  a { 
    thing: _pluck(list: "very.deeply.nested.list", path: "item") 
  }
}
```
which returns:
```json
{
  "a": {
    "thing": ["of", "values"]
  }
}
```


## Development

This helper is written in TypeScript, and `lib.js` is updated automatically. The actual file you want to edit is `lib.ts`.

Use 

    npm run build

to update the JS and rebuild README table of contents.

### TODO

* Unit tests, of course. @chasingmaxwell, can I reuse yours? :)
